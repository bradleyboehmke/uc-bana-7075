# Building and Managing Data Pipelines

## Introduction to Data Pipelines

- Definition of data pipelines and their importance in ML system design.
- The role of DataOps in constructing scalable and reliable data workflows.

## Tools for DataOps

Overview (and examples) of commonly used tools for DataOps:

- Data Ingestion: Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, Airbyte.
- Data Processing: Apache Spark, DBT, Pandas.
- Data Validation: Great Expectations, TFDV (TensorFlow Data Validation).
- Data Versioning: DVC, Delta Lake.

## Building Data Pipelines

Step-by-step guide to creating the components of a DataOps system.  This part will show system architecture diagrams to conceptually build a DataOps system

- Designing an ingestion framework that accommodates multiple data sources.
- Data cleaning, transformation, and feature extraction.
- Incorporating data validation to ensure quality.
- Versioning datasets for consistency and reproducibility.

## Creating Scalable Data Pipelines

- How to build data pipelines that scale to accommodate increasing data volumes.
- Key considerations for scalability, such as distributed processing and fault tolerance.

## Hands-On Example: Simple Data Pipeline for ML Workflows

- Demonstrate a simple end-to-end data pipeline that ingests, processes, validates, and versions a dataset.
- Walkthrough of using tools like Pandas, Great Expectations, and DVC to create a pipeline.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

- Summary of the key principles of DataOps and how to apply them in building effective data pipelines for ML.
- Reflection on the importance of data quality, management, and scalability in ML workflows.
