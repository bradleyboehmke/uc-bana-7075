Reading Time: 15-25 minutes
:::

DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes the integration of development (**Dev**) and operations (**Ops**) teams to improve the efficiency, speed, and reliability of software delivery. It emerged in response to the traditional siloed approach, where developers focused solely on writing code while operations teams were responsible for deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. This separation often led to bottlenecks, slow deployment cycles, and inefficient incident resolution.

The goal of DevOps is to streamline the software development lifecycle through automation, collaboration, and continuous feedback loops. It leverages practices such as continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), automated testing, and monitoring to ensure rapid and reliable software releases.

In the previous chapters, we explored how to build data pipelines, track and version datasets and models, and deploy and monitor models in simple scenarios. However, the role of DevOps is to simplify, standardize, automate, and scale these processes across an entire organization, ensuring robustness and efficiency at every stage.

DevOps concepts can be technologically complex, often requiring deep expertise in infrastructure, automation, and software engineering. However, most of the time, Software Engineering teams handle many of these implementations, or Data Scientists and ML Engineers work closely with them to integrate DevOps into ML workflows.

While mastering all the technical details is not necessary, understanding the role of DevOps in ML is crucial for building reliable and scalable systems. The goal of this chapter is to help readers grasp why DevOps concepts matter and how they contribute to efficient and maintainable ML workflows rather than focusing on deep technical implementation.

## The Value of DevOps in ML Systems

DevOps plays a crucial role in ensuring that ML systems are not just successfully developed but also efficiently deployed, maintained, and updated in production environments. By leveraging automation, scalability, and streamlined workflows, DevOps principles help data science teams focus on innovation while ensuring model reliability and performance in real-world applications. These principles directly support key ML system design principles such as reproducibility, automation, scalability, and maintainability, which were discussed in [Section @sec-design-principles].

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Automating Code & Model Updates

Automation is a core tenet of effective ML system design. One of the most significant challenges in ML workflows is keeping models up to date without causing disruptions. DevOps enables seamless automation of code and model updates through CI/CD pipelines, allowing teams to continuously integrate new data, retrain models, and deploy updated versions with minimal manual intervention. This ensures that models remain relevant and perform optimally as data evolves while maintaining reproducibility and consistency across environments.

Integrating DevOps into ML workflows enhances the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of ML  systems. By automating workflows, improving reliability, and standardizing deployment processes, organizations can effectively operationalize ML models and derive real business value from their ML investments.

## Key Concepts of DevOps for ML

Understanding how DevOps fits into ML systems requires understanding key concepts that support automation, scalability, and collaboration across teams. These concepts help ensure that ML systems are efficiently trained, tested, deployed, and maintained in production environments.

To measure the effectiveness of DevOps in ML systems, organizations rely on four key software delivery metrics^[As outlined in Google's 2019 State of DevOps Report: [https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf)]:

| Metric | DevOps Definition | Relation to ML Systems |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Deployment Frequency** | How often does your organization deploy code to production or release it to end-users? | In ML systems, the frequency of deployment often depends on:<br><br>1. Model retraining requirements, which can range from less frequent retraining for batch processes to constant "always on" retraining for online systems. Two aspects are crucial for model retraining<br>  (a) **New data availability**. Preferrably we want to retrain data as soon as new data is available to retrain on.<br> (b) **Model decay**. Typically we want to retrain a model as soon as we identify a decay in the model performance. <br><br>2. The level of automation of the deployment process, which might range between manual deployment and fully automated CI/CD pipeline. |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | How long does it take to go from code committed to code successfully running in production? | The *Lead Time for Changes* in an ML system depends on:<br>(1) Duration of the explorative phase in Data Science in order to finalize the ML model for deployment/serving.<br>(2) Duration of the ML model training.<br>(3) The number and duration of manual steps during the deployment process. |
| **Change Failure Rate** | What percentage of changes to production or released to users result in degraded service (e.g., lead to service impairment or service outage) and subsequently require remediation (e.g., require a hotfix, rollback, fix forward, patch)? | In ML systems, *Change Failure Rate* are often driven by three components of the system:<br> (1) **Infrastructure failure**: Infrastructure failures contribute to a high change failure rate if new deployments or updates cause system instability, unexpected resource constraints, or networking issues.<br>(2) **Model performance**: If an ML model deployed in production exhibits performance degradation (e.g., increased error rates, drift, or bias introduction), it may require immediate rollback or remediation.<br>(3) **Data pipeline failure**: Data pipeline failures can introduce corrupted, missing, or incorrect data, leading to failed model training or degraded predictions in production. |
| **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** | How long does it generally take to restore service when a service incident or a defect that impacts users occurs (e.g., unplanned outage or service impairment)? | In an ML system *Model MTTR* depends on the number and duration of manually performed debugging and deployment steps involved in the data pipeline and the model retraining, versioning, deployment, and monitoring pipelines. |

These metrics serve as benchmarks for improving DevOps practices and ensuring that ML systems are continuously delivering value with high reliability and efficiency. And these metrics are what drive the following key DevOps concepts:
