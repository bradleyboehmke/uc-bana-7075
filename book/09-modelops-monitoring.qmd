# Model Monitoring

::: {.callout-warning}
Reading Time: TBD
:::

Deploying a machine learning model is not the final step in an ML workflow, it’s just the beginning. Once a model is in production, its performance can degrade over time due to changes in data patterns, evolving user behavior, or shifts in external factors that were not present in the training data. Without a robust monitoring system in place, organizations risk relying on outdated or inaccurate predictions, which can lead to poor business decisions and financial losses.

Model monitoring provides a structured way to continuously track and evaluate model performance, ensuring reliability and accountability in production environments. It helps detect issues such as data drift (when the input data distribution changes), concept drift (when the relationship between inputs and outputs evolves), and operational failures (such as increased response times or system crashes). By implementing real-time monitoring, data teams can identify problems early, trigger alerts, and take corrective action — whether by retraining the model, adjusting its parameters, or even rolling back to a previous version.

This chapter will explore the different **types of model monitoring**, the **key components of an effective monitoring system**, and **popular tools** used to track model performance. We’ll also walk through a hands-on example, where we implement a basic monitoring system for the Apple Demand Forecasting Model introduced in previous chapters. By the end, you’ll understand how to build scalable, automated monitoring pipelines that keep models performant and aligned with business objectives.

## Why is Model Monitoring Important?

Machine learning models do not exist in a static environment—once deployed, they are exposed to new and evolving data that may differ from what they were trained on. Without continuous monitoring, model performance can degrade, leading to inaccurate predictions and potentially costly business decisions. Model monitoring is a critical component of an operational ML system, ensuring that models remain reliable, fair, and performant in real-world applications.

### Key Reasons for Model Monitoring

## Ensuring Performance Consistency

Over time, models may experience a decline in accuracy or other evaluation metrics due to shifts in data distributions or changes in real-world conditions. Monitoring helps track performance trends and detect issues early.

## Detecting Data Drift and Concept Drift

Models rely on patterns in historical data to make predictions. If these patterns shift (data drift) or the relationship between input features and predictions changes (concept drift), the model may no longer be valid. Monitoring helps catch these shifts before they cause significant problems.

## Maintaining Business Value

A poorly monitored model can lead to incorrect recommendations, financial losses, or compliance risks, depending on the application. By continuously tracking performance, organizations can proactively intervene when necessary.

## Ensuring Operational Stability

Beyond accuracy, models must also function efficiently in production environments. Monitoring helps track API response times, infrastructure performance, and overall system health.

To address these challenges, model monitoring systems track various aspects of model performance, including predictive accuracy, data consistency, and operational efficiency.

### Types of Model Monitoring

Effective model monitoring involves tracking multiple dimensions of model performance, data integrity, and system stability. The key types of monitoring include:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring tracks a model’s predictive accuracy over time to ensure that it continues to produce reliable outputs. Common metrics include:

- **Regression models:** RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), R²
- **Classification models:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
- **Forecasting models:** MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error)

When a model’s performance declines beyond an acceptable threshold, teams can investigate the cause and take corrective action, such as retraining the model with fresh data or adjusting its hyperparameters.

**Example:**  A demand forecasting model for a grocery retailer consistently achieves an RMSE of 50 units per week. However, after a few months, the RMSE increases to 120 units, indicating that the model’s predictions are becoming less reliable. Monitoring helps flag this change and allows the team to retrain the model with updated data.

## Data Drift Monitoring

Data drift occurs when the statistical properties of input features change over time. This can lead to unexpected model behavior and degraded performance. Monitoring data drift involves tracking feature distributions and identifying deviations from the training data.

**Key Indicators of Data Drift:**

- Changes in mean, variance, or distribution of input features.
- Increased outliers in newly ingested data.
- Shift in feature correlations compared to the training dataset.

**Example:** A machine learning model used for predicting loan approvals was trained on demographic data from five years ago. As economic conditions evolve, the average income distribution of applicants shifts, leading to a significant change in predictions. Data drift monitoring detects this shift and signals the need to update the model.

## Concept Drift Monitoring

Concept drift happens when the relationship between input features and predictions changes over time. Unlike data drift (which concerns changes in input data distribution), concept drift affects how a model interprets data.

**Common Causes of Concept Drift:**

- Changes in user behavior (e.g., customer preferences shift).
- Market changes affecting feature importance.
- Seasonality or external factors introducing new trends.

**Example:** A recommendation system for an e-commerce website suggests products based on past user behavior. However, as new shopping trends emerge (e.g., a sudden rise in eco-friendly products), user preferences change. Concept drift monitoring helps detect these shifts and prompts model adjustments.

## Operational Monitoring

Operational monitoring focuses on ensuring the reliability and efficiency of model-serving infrastructure. It tracks key deployment metrics, including:

- **API Latency:** Response time of the model’s predictions.
- **Infrastructure Load:** Resource consumption (CPU, memory, GPU usage).
- **Error Logs:** Detecting system failures, API timeouts, or unusual error rates.

**Example:** A fraud detection model deployed as an API for real-time transactions experiences an increase in response times from 100ms to 2 seconds. This delay could impact the customer experience and lead to transaction failures. Operational monitoring alerts engineers to the issue so they can optimize the model-serving pipeline.

Model monitoring is a crucial part of maintaining ML models in production, ensuring they remain accurate, robust, and scalable. Whether tracking predictive performance, detecting data drift, or maintaining operational stability, effective monitoring allows teams to intervene before performance issues impact business decisions.
