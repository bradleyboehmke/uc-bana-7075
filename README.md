UC BANA 7085 Machine Learning Design for Business
================

**By [Brad Boehmke](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke) ðŸš€**

This course aims to provide a framework for developing real-world machine learning systems that are deployable, reliable, and scalable.  Students are introduced to ***MLOps*** as the intersection of DataOps, ModelOps, and DevOps; combined, these concepts provide scalable, reliable, and repeatable machine learning workflows. Students will learn how MLOps enables organizations to overcome challenges in operationalizing machine learning models. Along the way, students will learn about important organizational issues including privacy, fairness, security, stakeholder management, project collaboration, and more!

Through lectures, hands-on exercises, and project work, students will explore the tools, techniques, and best practices required to successfully design and deploy machine learning systems in today's organizations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:

- Understand the value MLOps provides for organizations, including scalability, reliability, and speed in ML deployment.
- Describe the core components and key concepts of MLOps, including DataOps, ModelOps, and DevOps.
- Identify key decisions when designing MLOps workflows, such as data versioning, model monitoring, and deployment strategies.
- Gain hands-on experience with MLOps tooling, including experiment tracking, versioning, and automated deployment.
- Be exposed to important organizational issues including privacy, fairness, security, stakeholder management, project collaboration, and more!
