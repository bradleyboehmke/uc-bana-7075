# Course Overview  {background="#43464B"}

## ML System Design

ML is all around us

![](images/ML-uses.png){fig-align="center"}

## ML System Design

And more and more organizations are finding use cases for ML.

## ML System Design

But organizations are finding that...

- ML algorithms are the less problematic part.
- The hard part is to how to **make algorithms work with other parts to solve real-world problems**.

##  ML System Design

Most ML courses & books focus on the algos

. . .

<br>
We're going to focus on creating a system around the algos

### This class is designed to get you thinking about the following questions...

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
- You‚Äôve trained a model, now what?
- How do we measure if this model is improving the business?
- How do we manage the data feeding into this model?
- How do we track changes we make to this model?
- How do we deploy this model into production?
- How do monitor the health of this model?
- How do we manage the source code of an ML system?
- What human elements should we be concerned about with an ML system?
- ...
:::

## Learning Objectives {.smaller}

<br>

- Understand what goes into an [ML System and the value it provides]{style="color:blue;"} for organizations.

. . .

- Describe the core components and key concepts of [MLOps]{style="color:blue;"}, including DataOps, ModelOps, and DevOps.

. . .

- Gain [hands-on experience]{style="color:blue;"} with tools and techniques for building and deploying machine learning systems.

## Prereqs {.smaller}

This class is targeted towards:

- Graduate students - data scientists, engineers, and analytics professionals
- Individuals with a basic background in ML and software development
- Those interested in cross-functional collaboration between data science, engineering, and business teams

. . .

You don't need to be a strong programmer [but]{style="color:red;"} there is plenty of...

- code demonstrating implementation of MLOps concepts
- exercises/assignments that require hands-on work

. . .

<br>

So Python and ML familiarity will be very beneficial but not strictly required
